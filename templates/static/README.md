# __project__

A basic web application with no server component; just open index.html in your browser!

Note that if you are using a browser (e.g. Chrome) with tighter security settings, you may have to launch a simple web browser in order to run this static webpage.  I would recommend using either npm's http-server or Python from the project's directory (running bootstrap.sjs with --server will attempt to use http-server, or give a helpful error message):

    $ http-server -p 8080

or

    $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
